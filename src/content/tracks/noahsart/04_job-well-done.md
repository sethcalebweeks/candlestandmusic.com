_To commemorate the life of Rebekah Hoak (10/31/96 - 1/22/17)_

She always wanted to worship, she always wanted to praise you  
She always wanted to serve You and bless your holy name  

I miss her heart of worship, I miss her glow of joy  
I miss the way she chased You more than any boy  

Your light within her was like the sun  
Her gentle spirit was like a dove  
Her eyes were sweet and her face complete  
But her heart beneath far surpassed all these  

‘Job well done good and faithful one’  
Echoing in her ears from the Holy One  
‘You stood the test now enter in my rest  
Into the joy of your Master's happiness  
Where there will be no fear  
Where I have brought you near  
Where I will wipe each tear away’  

She always wanted to worship, she always wanted to praise you  
She always wanted to serve You and bless your holy name  

I miss her heart of worship, I miss her glow of joy  
I miss the way she chased You more than any boy  

Your light within her was like the sun  
Her gentle spirit was like a dove  
Her eyes were sweet and her face complete  
But her heart beneath far surpassed all these  

‘Job well done good and faithful one’  
Echoing in her ears from the Holy One  
‘You stood the test now enter in my rest  
Into the joy of your Master's happiness  
Where there will be no fear  
Where I have brought you near  
Where I will wipe each tear away’  

‘Job well done, Job well done’  
Echoing in her ears, in her ears  

‘Job well done, Job well done’  
Echoing in her ears, in her ears

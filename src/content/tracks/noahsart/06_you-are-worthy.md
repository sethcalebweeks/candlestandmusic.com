_When You said, "Seek My face," my heart said to You, 
"Your face, O LORD, I shall seek." Psalm 27:8_

You are worthy, You're the one who suffered  
You are holy, there is no one other  
Who is like You! There is none in all the universe  
Who can match Your worth Lord  

You are gracious, You are kind and caring  
You are patient, You're content and sharing  
You are holy, all the glory only unto You  
For only You are worthy of all praise and love it's true  

I love You, ‘cause You love me  

In the secret, in the quiet place  
I will seek You, I will seek Your face  
Try to please You, try to know You like I know I should  
I know I should Lord  

Be more gracious, be more kind and caring  
Be more patient, more content and sharing  
Be more holy, bringing glory only unto You  
For only You are worthy of my praise and love it's true  

You are worthy, You're the one who suffered  
You are holy, there is no one other  
Who is like You! There is none in all the universe  
Who can match You worth Lord  

Make me gracious make me kind and caring  
Make me patient, more content and sharing  
Make me holy, bringing glory only unto You  
For only You are worthy of my praise and love it's true  

Just You  

I love You, ‘cause You love me  
I love You, ‘cause You love me

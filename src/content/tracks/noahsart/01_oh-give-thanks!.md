_“O give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; 
For His lovingkindness is everlasting.”
1 Chronicles 16:34_

He's my Savior and my rest  
He's my source of righteousness    
When this world may trouble me  
He's my shelter and my peace  
He's my shelter and my peace  

I am loved and I am His  
Oh what comfort these words give  
Let my thankfulness abound  
For in Him my hope is found  
For in Him my hope is found  

Oh, give thanks unto the Lord!  
For He is good  
For His steadfast love endures  
Forevermore and evermore  
Forevermore His love endures  

He'll return victorious  
Victory He gives to us  
We don't need to be afraid  
For our price He fully paid  
For our price He fully paid  

Oh, give thanks unto the Lord!  
For He is good  
For His steadfast love endures  
Forevermore and evermore  
Forevermore His love endures

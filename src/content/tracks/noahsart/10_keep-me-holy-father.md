_"For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, 
so that we do not drift away from it." Hebrews 2:1_

Keep me, Holy Father, lead me, lest I wander  
Teach me, as I ponder, Your will for my life, in Jesus Christ  

Shape me, to Your image, daily, let me live it  
Change me, 'till it's vivid, so I may honor You in all I do  

For the ransom of my life, has been paid in Jesus Christ  
The One my hunger satisfied, the well of love that won't run dry  
And love, oh love, so incredible and true  
Oh, don't let me drift away from You  

Hold me, Holy Father, mold me, to Your honor  
Scold me, if I wander, for nothing is worth more than you my Lord  

And the ransom of my life, has been paid in Jesus Christ  
The One my hunger satisfied, the well of love that won't run dry  
And love, oh love, so incredible and true  
Oh, don't let me drift away from You  

Teach me Your ways, teach me Your ways  
Lead me today, lead me today  
Teach me Your ways, teach me Your ways  
Lead me today  

For the ransom of my life, has been paid in Jesus Christ  
The One my hunger satisfied, the well of love that won't run dry  
And love, oh love, so incredible and true  
Don't let me drift away from…   

The ransom of my life, has been paid in Jesus Christ  
He’s the One my hunger satisfied, the well of love that won't run dry  
And love, oh love, so incredible and true  
Oh, don't let me drift away from You  
Don't let me drift away   
Don't let me drift away from You

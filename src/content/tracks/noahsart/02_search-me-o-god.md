_Psalm 139:4-5, 8-10, 23-24_

Even before a word is on my tongue  
Behold, O Lord, You know it  
You hem me in, behind and before  
And lay your hand upon me  
And lay your hand upon me  

If I rise to heavens to run away from you  
Or dive to the depths of the sea  
There even there Your hand will lead me  
And Your right hand will lay hold of me  
And Your right hand will lay hold of me  

There, there, there wherever I go  
You’re there, there, You’re there wherever I go  

Search me, O God, and know my heart  
Try me and know my anxious thoughts  
And see if there be any grievous way in me  
And lead me in the everlasting way  
And lead me in the everlasting way  

There, there, there wherever I go  
There, You’re there, You’re there wherever I go  

There, there, You’re there wherever I go  
There, You’re there, You’re there wherever I go

As summer falls on autumn leaves, our children fall to the enemy  
Lord we're falling on our knees, give oh give them faith  
We've tried so hard to teach them Truth, yet they drifted as they grew  
Lord we lift them up to You, give oh give them faith  

The winter comes with the darkness too, still their darkened hearts refuse  
Lord we pray You'd light a fuse, give oh give them faith  

Keep them from the evil one, not our will but Yours be done  
Lord we pray that they may come, give oh give them faith  

Give oh give them faith to see You're all you say You are  
Give oh give them true belief and open up their hearts   

Give oh give them faith to see You're all you say You are  
Give oh give them true belief and open up their hearts  

Father we cry to You, we call upon Your name  
Jesus we look to You, we look to You for grace  
Spirit we wait for You, work in them we pray  
Father we cry to You, give oh give them faith  

As the winter blossoms into spring, we hear the little children sing  
Lord we pray for Your blessing, give oh give them faith  
Would You help us teach them Truth, Lord we lift them up to You  
And we pray You're Spirit move, give oh give them faith  

Give oh give them faith to see You're all you say You are  
Give oh give them true belief and open up their hearts   

Give oh give them faith to see You're all you say You are  
Give oh give them true belief and open up their hearts  

Father we cry to You, we call upon Your name  
Jesus we look to You, we look to You for grace  
Spirit we wait for You, work in them we pray  
Father we cry to You, give oh give them faith!  
give oh give them faith!  

The rains of spring bring summer fruit, Lord we offer thanks to You  
For everyone You freely choose, to give oh give them faith,  
Give oh give them faith  
Give oh give them faith

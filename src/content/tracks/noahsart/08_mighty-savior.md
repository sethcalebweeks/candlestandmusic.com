_"Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship." Romans 12:1_

Thank You Lord, for Your love  
And Your mercy on us  
For Your grace, and your peace  
And Your patience with me  

For the blood, that You shed  
For Your body, our bread  
For Your life, and Your death  
And Your rising again  

Thank You Lord, Jesus Christ  
Mighty Savior, of my life  
Take my heart, make it Yours  
Be the one it’s beating for  

Thank You Lord, for Your truth  
And the knowledge of You  
For Your rod, and Your staff  
And that You’re holding, me fast.  
For the way that You made  
For the price that You paid  

Thank You Lord, Jesus Christ  
Mighty Savior, of my life  
Take my heart, make it Yours  
Be the one it’s beating for  

Thank You Lord (thank You Lord)  
Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)  
Mighty Savior, (mighty Savior)  
Of my life (of my life)  
Take my heart (take my heart)  
Make it Yours (make it Yours)  
Be the one it’s beating for

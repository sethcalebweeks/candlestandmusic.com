_"For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come." Hebrews 13:14_

This is not our home  
We are strangers here  
Looking for our hope when He appears  

We are citizens  
Of another place  
Where the lion and lamb together lay  

We've no city here  
But we look to one  
Where He'll wipe our tears, and dwell with us  

What a blessed hope  
What a glorious day  
What a joy to know this coming grace  

And every knee shall bow (every knee)  
And every tongue proclaim (every tongue)  
Jesus Christ Lord forevermore  

And every knee shall bow (every knee)  
And every tongue proclaim (every tongue)  
Jesus Christ Lord forevermore  

_We will dance and we will sing  
Praising Him and worshiping  
The King of Kings and Lord of Lords  
Weâ€™ll be with Him forevermore_  

What a blessed hope (blessed hope)  
What a glorious day (glorious day)  
What a joy to know this coming grace

_Psalm 46:1-3, Hebrews 13:5b_

Though the mountains start to shake  
And waters roar and foam  
You, oh Lord, will not forsake  
The ones You call Your own  

An ever present help You are  
Our refuge and our strength  
Therefore, we will not fear  
Though the earth gives way  

Though the mountains start to shake  
And waters roar and foam  
You, oh Lord, will not forsake  
The ones You call Your own  

An ever present help You are  
Our refuge and our strength  
Therefore, we will not fear  
Though the earth gives way  

Though the heart within me breaks  
And I feel all alone  
You, oh Lord, will not forsake  
The ones You call Your own  

An ever present help You are  
Our refuge and our strength  
Therefore, we will not fear  
Though the earth   
Though the earth  
Though the earth gives way

_"Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD!" Psalm 150:6_

Oh, chipmunks love to praise the Lord (animals love to praise the Lord)  
To the end of every day (to the end of every day)  
We should love to praise the Lord (we should love to praise the Lord)  
To the end of every day  

The lion loves to roar  
The eagle loves to soar  
When the dolphins swim  
They are praising Him alone  

The chipmunks love to play  
The dogs all bark and say  
That the Lord is king  
Who has made all things below  

Animals love to praise the Lord (animals love to praise the Lord)  
To the end of every day (to the end of every day)  
We should love to praise the Lord (we should love to praise the Lord)  
To the end of every day  

(â€¦and at night...the nocturnal animals!)  

The cheetah loves to run  
The rhino weighs a ton  
The cats have claws  
And the beavers gnaws the wood  

But look at you and me  
It just so clear to see  
That the Lord is king  
And He made all things so good  

Chipmunks love to praise the Lord (animals love to praise the Lord)  
To the end of every day (to the end of every day)  
We should love to praise the Lord (we should love to praise the Lord)  
To the end of every  
To the end of every  
To the end of every day

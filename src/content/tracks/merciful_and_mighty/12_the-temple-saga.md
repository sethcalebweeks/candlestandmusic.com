When the garden was a temple and Adam was a priest  
Just one command He gave to man and warned him of the tree  
But they listened to the serpent and turned it upside down  
Our God had made a dwelling place now man was driven out   

Till the covenant of Moses, this separation stood  
For God on high could not abide with man who fell from good  
But in mercy and with wonders He led them through the sea  
The Savior made His dwelling place with those He had redeemed   

And His glory filled the temple, the temple in the land  
Sanctified and set aside to house the Great I Am  
Though the heavens can't contain You, though Your dwelling is on high  
Father in Your mercy, You bring us to Your side  

But the people turned against You, and spurned Your holy place  
By worshipping their worthless things before Your very face  
So, You rose in holy anger and burned the temple down  
You left the city desolate and drove the people out   

But Your sovereign hand of mercy worked wonders once again  
You made a way for castaways to find Jerusalem  
And the promises You gave them were greater even still  
A King would come from David's Sons and soon it was fulfilled   

And Your glory filled the temple, the temple of a man  
Sanctified and set aside to house the Great I Am  
Though the heavens can't contain You, though Your dwelling is on high  
Jesus in Your mercy, You came to us to die  

But the leaders of the temple were blind to recognize  
How Jesus was the righteous one the temple symbolized  
In their pride and in their envy, they rallied up a mob  
To crucify the Lord of life and kill the Son of God   

But the wonder of Your mercy was shown on the cross  
Slain by us unrighteous ones You later would adopt  
And You offer us forgiveness in spite of all weâ€™ve done  
And comfort us by sending us Your Spirit till You come  

And Your glory fills the temple, of woman and of man  
Sanctified and set aside to house the Great I Am  
Though the heavens can't contain You, though Your dwelling is on high  
Spirit by Your mercy, You dwell with us inside  

Till the day there is no temple, the day You dwell with man  
Sanctified and glorified in new Jerusalem  
Where the King will reign forever, forever with His bride  
Covered by Your mercy, and always by Your side

title: Seed - Serpent - Promise

Mary felt the pain of giving birth   
Eve had brought the reign of such a curse  
But the promise of the Spirit was a Seed  
And by that very Spirit she conceived  

And on the story goes  
Timeless and today  
The Seed against the serpent and the promise God has made  

Soon the child grew to be a man  
David’s line and Seed of Abraham  
He stood against the serpent from of old  
And took what we deserved, the fatal blow  

And on the story goes  
Timeless and today   
The Seed against the serpent and the promise God has made   

And when the serpent bites  
When the Seed should die   
The promise stands to Abraham, the dead are raised to life   
The promise stands to Abraham, the dead are raised to life  

All creation groans at giving birth  
Inwardly we moan because it hurts  
But Mary’s cries of labor were relieved  
When she saw the Savior on her knees  

And on the story goes  
Timeless and today   
The Seed against the serpent and the promise God has made   

The promise is secure!  
Holy is the Seed   
And He will crush the evil one forever at His feet   
Oh, He will crush the evil one forever at His feet  

The promise is secure!  
Holy is the Seed   
And He will crush the evil one forever at His feet   
Oh, He will crush the evil one forever at His feet

You're worthy Lord, of all my heart   
You're worthy of my soul   
And all my mind, and all my strength   
You're worthy of it all   

You're worthy Lord, of all my heart   
You're worthy of my soul   
And all my mind, and all my strength   
You're worthy of it all   

And no one else, no one else is worthy  
No one else, no one else deserves that love  
Nothing else, nothing else is worthy   
And no one showed a greater love

You're worthy Lord, to reign as king   
You're worthy to be praised   
With wisdom, might, wealth and strength  
Forever You shall reign  

And no one else, no one else is worthy  
No one else, no one else deserves that love  
Nothing else, nothing else is worthy   
And no one showed a greater love   

You're worthy to be honored, praised and glorified   
You're worthy of the throne both in heaven and our lives  
Worthy is the King who bowed to wash our feet  
Oh, at the name of Jesus, all will bend their knees   

And no one else, no one else is worthy  
No one else, no one else deserves that love  
Nothing else, nothing else is worthy   
And no one showed a greater love   
No one showed a greater love

title: Take and Eat
album: Merciful & Mighty

She saw it hang upon the tree  
She took and ate, we bore the curse  
But see Him hang upon a tree  
Now take and eat, He bore the curse, for us.   

The cup He drank was full of wrath  
He drained its dregs, on our behalf  
This cup we drink is full of life   
It satisfies, the payment price, for us.   

So, take this bread, and drink this cup  
Remember Him, and His great love  
Take this bread, and drink this cup  
Remember Him, until He comes   

Take this bread, and drink this cup  
Remember Him, and His great love  
Take this bread, and drink this cup  
Remember Him, until He comes again   

_"So simple the act, so hard its undoing. 
God will taste poverty and death before “Take and eat” become verbs of salvation."
- Derek Kidner_

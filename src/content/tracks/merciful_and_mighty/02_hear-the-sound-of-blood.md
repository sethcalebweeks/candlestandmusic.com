Hear the sound of blood, rising from the ground  
Voices lifting up: “why was I poured out?”  
When will vengeance come? Violence fills the streets  
And martyrs cry “How long till judgement is decreed?”  

Wait a little longer, patiently endure  
Till the saints are numbered, till the wine is poured  
He who treads the winepress, drank its bitter the cup  
Oh, He is qualified as, universal judge  

He’s sharpening His sword, He’s bending back His bow  
The Day of the Lord, has long been foretold (oh, oh)  
And everyone will drink, Jesus' bitter cup  
Be careful if You think, You're better than God's Son  

See Him on the cross, naked as He bleeds  
Drinking every drop, of the wrath for you and me  
Worship Him with reverence, fall on bended knee  
Oh, follow with repentance, or fall beneath His feet

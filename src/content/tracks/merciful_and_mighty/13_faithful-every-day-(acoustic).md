Lord another day is through  
It’s time to sing our praise to You   
And bless You for our daily food  
You’re faithful every day   

The sun arose right on its mark  
Ran its course and now it’s dark   
And all the stars tell who You are  
You’re faithful every day   

So, we praise You faithful God  
Faithful every day   
Praise You faithful God  
Give us greater faith         
‘Cause You’re faithful every day  
You’re faithful every day    

Light and light You give to us  
You who formed us from the dust  
Give us hearts that we may trust  
You’re faithful every day   

The rain descends and storm winds blow  
The sun draws out Your sweet rainbow   
The springtime always melts the snow  
You’re faithful every day  

So, we praise You faithful God  
Faithful every day   
Praise You faithful God  
Give us greater faith         
‘Cause You’re faithful every day  
You’re faithful every day     
You’re faithful every day  
And You’ll always stay that way   

But Lord some days are really hard  
And sorrow fills our weary hearts  
But even in these feelings You are  
Faithful every day   

When Lazarus was in the tomb  
You would raise him as You knew   
But still You wept with Mary too  
‘Cause You’re faithful every day  

So, we praise You faithful God  
Faithful in our pain   
Praise You faithful God  
Give us greater faith  
‘Cause You’re faithful every day  
You’re faithful every day  

We praise You faithful God  
Faithful in our pain   
Praise You faithful God  
Give us greater faith  
‘Cause You’re faithful every day  
You’re faithful every day  
You’re faithful every day  
And You’ll always stay that way

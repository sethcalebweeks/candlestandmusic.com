God I come   
Near to You  
Through Your Son  
By His wounds  

Through the veil  
Torn in two  
Through His flesh  
Near to You   

You are holy, holy, holy is the Lord, the Almighty  

And who am I  
To approach  
God most high  
On His throne  

Where cherubim  
Day and night  
Worship Him  
As they cry  

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, the Almighty  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, the Almighty  

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, God Most High  

So, worship Christ, worship Christ, worship Christ with all Your heart   
Lift Him high, lift Him high, lift Him high with all You are   

For He is holy, holy, holy is the Lord, El-Shaddai  

So, worship Christ, worship Christ, worship Christ with all Your heart   
Lift Him high, lift Him high, lift Him high with all You are   

For He is holy, holy, holy is the Lord, God Most High  

So, worship Christ, worship Christ, worship Christ with all Your heart   
Lift Him high, lift Him high, lift Him high with all You are   

For He is holy, holy, holy is the Lord, El-Shaddai   

So, worship Christ, worship Christ, worship Christ with all Your heart   
In your life, your daily life, lift Him high with all You are   

For He is holy, holy, holy is the Lord, God Most High  

So, worship Christ, worship Christ, worship Christ with all Your heart   
Lift Him high, lift Him high, lift Him high with all You are   

For He is holy, holy, holy is the Lord, God Most High

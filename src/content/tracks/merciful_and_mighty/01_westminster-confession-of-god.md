There is only one eternal universal God  
Who is infinite in being and perfection unlike us  
He’s a Spirit without body whom no human eye can see   
He’s immutable, immense, immortal, limit-less and free   

He’s most wise, most gracious  
Most kind, and so patient   
Full of compassion, faithful to us   
Forgiving our sins, and abounding in love  

But He won’t clear the guilty, just He will judge   
So He laid all our guilt, on His Son  

God is all sufficient, self-existent, self-sustained   
With all glory, life and goodness, self-derived and self-contained   
He’s the fountain of all being, He’s the sovereign potentate   
(hey) and from and through and in and to Him everything was made  

He’s most wise, most gracious  
Most kind, and so patient   
Full of compassion, faithful to us   
Forgiving our sins, and abounding in love  

But He won’t clear the guilty, just He will judge   
So He laid all our guilt, on His Son (oh!)  
He won’t clear the guilty, just He will judge   
So He laid all our guilt, on His Son

title: Your Promises Are Better
album: Merciful & Mighty

Your promises are better than the best things I have known  
My share of Your inheritance is far beyond all gold   
So even if I'm threatened with the loss of all I own   
I possess a promise that I have a better home     
I possess a promise that I have a better home  

The life You give is greater than the best life I could know  
The city that we'll live in is magnificent and gold   
So even if the narrow is a dark and lonely road   
The pioneer has made it clear the Way will lead us home   
The pioneer has made it clear the Way will lead us home (oh yeah!)  

The love You have is deeper than the deepest I could know  
You gave Your life to pay the price and have me as Your own   
So even if I'm desolate, forsaken and alone   
You've made it clear, You're always here and soon you'll bring us home   
You've made it clear, You're always here and soon you'll bring us home  

Oh! Your promises are brimming with a well of living hope  
You've given me identity as treasured, loved, and known   
So even if they separate my body from my soul   
Oh, I possess a promise that I have a better home   
Yeah, I possess a promise of an everlasting home  
Oh, I possess a promise that Iâ€™ll live within Your home

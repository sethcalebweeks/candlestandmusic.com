Though Pharaoh’s army closes in  
And we're surrounded, trapped and pinned  
All this time He had in mind a grand design to win   

So, sing ye children of the Mighty One  
Tender-hearted and dearly loved   
The King is coming with a mighty hand   
To bring you to the promised land  

Though the fig tree fails to bloom   
And famine strikes ‘till there's no food  
We can sing and praise our King with faith He'll bring us through   

So, sing ye children of the Mighty One  
Tender-hearted and dearly loved   
The King is coming with a mighty hand   
To bring you to the promised land  

Though they crowned His head with thorns   
And hung Him high for all to scorn  
In the three days, the tables changed, for He was raised as Lord!   

So, sing ye children of the Mighty One  
Tender-hearted and dearly loved   
The King is coming with a mighty hand   
To bring you to the promised land  

Though we are oppressed and crushed   
We are safe in His great love  
Though it be we die like sheep we'll rise and see we've won   

So, sing ye children of the Mighty One  
Tender-hearted and dearly loved   
The King is coming with a mighty hand   
To bring you to the promised  

Oh, sing ye children of the Mighty One  
Don't you know your God will come?  
And bring His children with a mighty hand  
Safe into the promised land

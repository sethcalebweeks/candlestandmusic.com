Sovereign hands bled for me   
And He commanded this to be   
And chose me, in mercy, from the start  
Predestined, to bless Him, with all my heart  

Hallelujah! Oh, He’s the one who saves our souls   
Hallelujah! Praise God and God alone   

Sovereign hands are holding me   
And He commanded everything   
And bought me, and brought me to His throne  
Adopted, and spotless, I’m going home  

Hallelujah! He’s the one who saves our souls   
Hallelujah! Praise God and God alone   

Sovereign mercy saves our souls   
We bring nothing on our own   
Sovereign mercy saves our souls   
We bring nothing on our own   

Sovereign mercy saves our souls   
We bring nothing on our own   
Sovereign mercy saves our souls   
We bring nothing on our own   

Hallelujah! He’s the one who saves our souls   
Hallelujah! Praise God and God alone   

Sovereign mercy saves our souls   
We bring nothing on our own   
Sovereign mercy saves our souls   
We bring nothing on our own   

Sovereign mercy saves our souls   
We bring nothing on our own   
Sovereign mercy saves our souls   
We bring nothing on our own   

Hallelujah!

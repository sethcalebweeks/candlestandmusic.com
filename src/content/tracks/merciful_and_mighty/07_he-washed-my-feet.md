title: He Washed My Feet
album: Merciful & Mighty
---
He washed my feet   
Covered in manure from the dusty streets  
Never should He do it but the King of Kings  
Stooped down to me  

And washed my feet   
Totally outrageous! But He washed my feet  
Humble and courageous it was out of place  
But oh such grace  

What a mighty act of love  
Putting us above Himself  
Now He has commanded us  
To love each other just as well  

To wash their feet  
Loving one another as we wash their feet  
The sisters and the brothers ‘cause He showed us how  
Now we bow down   

To wash their feet  
Following our Savior as we wash their feet  
Caring for our neighbor as we learn from Christ  
What love looks like  

What a mighty act of love  
Putting us above Himself  
Now He has commanded us  
To love each other just as well  

Father would You help us please  
Pour Your Spirit in our hearts  
Move in us to wash their feet  
Knowing how loved we are (2x)  

You washed our feet  
Covered in the filth of all our shameful deeds  
Suffering our guilt is how You bowed down low  
And took the blow  

You washed our feet  
Laying down Your life is how You washed our feet  
Paying such a price is how You loved us first  
Now it’s our turn  

What a mighty act of love  
Putting us above Yourself  
Now You have commanded us  
To love each other just as well  

(So) Father would You help us please  
Pour Your Spirit in our hearts  
Move in us to wash their feet  
Knowing how loved we are (4x)

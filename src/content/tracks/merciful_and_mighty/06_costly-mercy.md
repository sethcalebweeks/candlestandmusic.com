Hallelujah! Gracious Lord   
God of mercy   
Evermore   

Lord Your mercy is a river  
Washing all our guilt away  
You took on the stain of sinners   
And offered no complaint  

Lord Your mercy is a facet  
At the core of who You are  
And in order that we grasp it   
You made us touch Your scar(s)  

So, hallelujah! God be praised  
With costly mercy we are saved!   

Hallelujah! Gracious Lord   
God of mercy   
Evermore   

Lord Your mercy is a mystery  
Hidden from the dawn of time  
How the One whose writing history  
Wrote crucifixion's line   

Lord Your mercy is astounding  
How you take the pain for us  
But You said that You're abounding  
In just this kind of love   
(Just this kind of love)  

Hallelujah! God be praised   
With costly mercy we are saved!   

Hallelujah! God be praised   
With costly mercy we are saved!

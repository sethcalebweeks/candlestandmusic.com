title: You Never Cease to Be...
album: Restore

When the cares of my heart, carry me along  
And the fear that I face, seems to hide Your grace  
When the undertow is strong  
And I cannot right what’s wrong  
But You never change, You never change  

You never cease to be holy, You never cease to be good  
You never cease to be worthy of praise   
No matter what we face  
Still You are faithful, still You are true  
Still You are sovereign, righteous, holy God  
In everything You do, in everything You do  

When the fiery trials come, and our faith is put to rest   
We feel the burning coals, refining us like gold  
We hope for Your rest, and hold Your name as blessed  
‘Til Your purposes unfold, let Your purposes unfold  

Still You never cease to be holy  
You never cease to be good  
You never cease to be worthy of praise   
No matter what we face  
Still You are faithful, still You are true  
Still You are worthy of praise   
No matter what we face  

Still You are sovereign, still you are blameless,  
Still You are just and incredibly gracious!  
You’re righteous, Creator  
Our stronghold, and Savior  
You’re steadfast, You’re holy  
You’re matchless in glory!  
You’re Abba, Father,  
You’re Sovereign, righteous, holy God  
In everything you do, in everything you do

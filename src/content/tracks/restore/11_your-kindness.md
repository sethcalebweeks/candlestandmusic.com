Lord restore my heart, draw me close to You  
When I feel so far, come remind me of the Truth  
Lord restore my heart, make it white and clean  
Just the way You are, and let Your Spirit dwell in me  

Your kindness leads us to repentance  
You're standing, knocking at the door  
Oh, in kindness bring us to our senses  
Bring our sinful hearts to love You Lord  

Lord renew my mind, give me eyes to see  
How You've been so kind, and so merciful to me  
Lord restore my soul, lead me by the stream  
Fill and make me whole, and let Your Spirit dwell in me  

Your kindness leads us to repentance  
You're standing, knocking at the door  
Oh, in kindness bring us to our senses  
Bring our sinful hearts to love You Lord  

Father would You sanctify the people of Your name!  
Give us faith to imitate the kindness Youâ€™ve displayed  

For Your kindness leads us to repentance  
You're standing, knocking at the door  
Oh, in kindness bring us to our senses  
Bring our sinful hearts to love You Lord

How could a just and holy God  
See my guilt and spare the rod?  
Why would He crush His son to death  
And credit me with righteousness?  
With His righteousness  

Redemption came at a costly price  
Valued at the blood of Christ   
Crucified, He purchased us  
To make us a kingdom of priests to God  
Redeemed as priests to God  

So, hallelujah, You have won the victory  
Hallelujah, for You paid the price for me  
Hallelujah, Your reign will never cease  
Hallelujah, hallelujah   

The enemy held his grip on us  
But Christ arose victorious  
And rescued us from the dark domain  
Every kingdom He shall reign   
Forever Christ shall reign  

So, hallelujah, You have won the victory  
Hallelujah, for You paid the price for me  
Hallelujah, Your reign will never cease  

So, hallelujah, You won the victory  
Hallelujah, You paid the price for me  
Hallelujah, Your reign will never cease  
Hallelujah, hallelujah

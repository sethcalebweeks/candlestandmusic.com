Where have you been hiding treasure?  
Can you keep it there forever?  
Is it safe and is it sound?   
In a place that won't be found?  
Will the moth and will the rust   
Consume your treasure to the dust?  
What if no tomorrow comes?   
What if all your days are done?  
Who will own what you have stored  
The day you meet the Lord?  

We are headed to a kingdom  
We’re headed to a home we don't deserve  
And for worse or for better  
Your heart is with your treasure  
And there you'll serve  

What if you could hide your treasure  
In a place that's so much better?  
Where the kingdom won't be shaken  
Where the city has foundations  
As you guard your heart from greed  
Watch Him grant your every need  
And you find the joy of giving  
Running wild in how you're living  
Knowing that you have in store  
Your treasure in the Lord   

We are headed to a kingdom  
We’re headed to a home we don't deserve  
And for worse or for better  
Your heart is with your treasure  
And there you'll serve  

Where have you been hiding treasure?  
Where have you been hiding treasure?

title: When Will I Be Home?
album: Restore
---
Children of light and strangers here  
Dark is the night 'till our hope appears  
Groaning until we see that day,  
And while we're here, we feel this pain  

When will my spirit no longer groan?  
When will I know You as I've been known?  
When will I see You and be like You?  
Oh, when will I be home?  

Longing by faith for a city to come  
Eagerly waiting and still pressing on  
With works of faith, expressed in love  
Until the day, we meet above  

When will I walk on the street of gold  
With a brand-new body that won’t grow old  
When will the old things pass away  
No mourning, crying, curse or pain  
When will I finally understand  
The wisdom and wonder in all Your plans  
When will the heaven and earth be new  
With all things subject unto You  

When will I see, will I see Your face  
Will I know Your sweet, incredible grace  
When will I gaze on the one who died  
With tears of amazement filling my eyes   
When will You reach out and wipe those tears  
And dwell with us through the endless years  
When will we struggle no more with sin  
And death shall die and Christ shall win!  

Then my spirit will never groan  
Then I will know You as I've been known  
Then I will see You and be like You  
Oh, then I will be home

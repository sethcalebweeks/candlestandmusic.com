When you're the one to blame  
And all you feel is shame  
And godly sorrow fills your heart  
It's leading you to change  

When you're the one to blame  
You caused another pain  
But know this sorrow leads to life  
And wholeness once again  

It leads you, it leads you, it leads you to repent  
And leaves you, it leaves you, it leaves you no regret  

The Son of God was slain  
And you're the one to blame  
But when godly sorrow fills your heart  
It breaks away your chains  

It leads you, it leads you, it leads you to repent  
And leaves you, it leaves you, it leaves you no regret  
It leads you, it leads you, it leads you to repent  
And leaves you, it leaves you, it leaves you no regret  

When they're the one to blame  
And all you feel is pain  
Pray this sorrow fills their heart  
Cause you've been in their place  

Lead them, oh lead them, lead them to repent  
Lord, leave them, leave them, leave them no regret  
Lead them, lead them, lead them to repent  
Lord, leave them, leave them, leave them no regret

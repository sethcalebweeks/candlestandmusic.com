Sweet feast of love divine!  
’Tis grace that makes us free  
To feed upon this bread and wine,  
In mem’ry, Lord, of Thee  

Here conscience ends its strife,  
And faith delights to prove  
The sweetness of the Bread of Life,  
The fulness of Thy love  

That blood that flowed for sin  
In symbol here we see,  
And feel the blessed pledge within  
That we are loved of Thee  

O if this glimpse of love  
Is so divinely sweet,  
What will it be, O Lord, above,  
Thy gladd’ning smile to meet!  

To see Thee face to face,  
Thy perfect likeness wear,  
And all Thy ways of wondrous grace  
Through endless years declare  

That blood that flowed for sin  
In symbol here we see,  
And feel the blessed pledge within  
That we are loved… of Thee.

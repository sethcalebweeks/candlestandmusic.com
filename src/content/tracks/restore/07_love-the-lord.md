שְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ יְהוָ֥ה׀ אֶחָֽד  
You shall love the Lord your God  
With all your heart, with all your soul  
Oh, love the Lord your God  
With all your heart, soul, mind, and strength  
And love your neighbor as yourself  
Love your neighbor as yourself  
If you do these two commands  
You keep all the laws demands.  

Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one!  

You shall love the Lord your God  
With all your heart, with all your soul  
Oh, love the Lord your God  
With all your heart, soul, mind, and strength  
And love your neighbor as yourself  
Love your neighbor as yourself  
If you do these two commands  
You keep all the laws demands.  

And a new command He gave  
The night before He died  
Love each other in the way  
I loved you with my life.  

So love the Lord your God  
With all your heart, with all your soul  
Oh, love the Lord your God   
With all your heart, soul, mind, and strength  
And love your neighbor as yourself  
Love your neighbor as yourself  
If you do these two commands  
You keep all the laws demands.  

Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one!

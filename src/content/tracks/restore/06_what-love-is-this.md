title: What Love Is This?

What love is this that a King would die?  
That He might save a rebelâ€™s life  
And raise them up to heavenly heights  
What love is this, in Jesus Christ?   
What love is this, in Jesus Christ?  

What love is this may I understand?  
That I might keep Your great commands  
To love You Lord above all else  
And love my neighbor as myself  

Help me love my neighbor as myself  
What love is this, may I know the height  
For You are holy, clothed in light  
Yet You give eternal life  
Living water without price   
Living water without price  

What love is this, may I know the depth  
Descending even unto death  
And bending down to wash our feet  
Oh may this love abide in me  
Oh may this love abide in me  

What love is this, how wide and long  
How can it be that I belong?

Lord restore my heart to You  

Lord restore my heart to You  
It feels so long since I’ve been near You  
Draw me closer to Your side  
Though I want to run and hide  
Wash my sins and make me new  
Lord restore my heart to You  

Lord I long to worship You  
It’s what my heart was meant to do  
But oh how idols tempt my heart  
They steal my joy and leave me dark  
But let Your light shine down on me  
Lord forgive and pardon me  

Lord remind me of the truth  
And all the goodness found in You  
Save me Lord and I’ll be saved  
Heal me for You are my praise  
There’s no other fount of life  
Oh give me water Jesus Christ  

Draw me closer to Your side  
Teach me humbly to abide  
Wash my sins and make me new  
Lord restore my heart to You

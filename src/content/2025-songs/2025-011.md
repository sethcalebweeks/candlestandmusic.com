title: 011 Clothed in Christ
---

We are clothed in Christ \
We are covered by the blood that makes us white \
We are clothed in Christ \
The Lamb our sacrifice 

We're crippled by the weight of shame \
And try our best to hide \
Afraid that He may call our name \
And all will come to light 

We wear the fig leaves for our clothes \
But God alone provides \
The righteous drip we can cannot sew \
The Lamb of God who died 

Stop hiding in your shame and fear \
For we are not exposed \
Receive the gospel loud and clear \
In Him You're fully clothed 

So throw away your little leaves \
And put on Jesus Christ \
He took our shame so crippling \
And clothed us with His life

We sew the finest fig leaves \
Weaving Gucci for our souls \
But still can't hide the shame the mirror shows \
But coming to our Father \
He pulls out the finest robe \
And clothes us with a garment of His own \
He clothes us with a garment we can't sew 

We are clothed, in Christ \
We are covered by the blood that makes us white \
We are clothed, in Christ \
The Lamb our sacrifice \
The Lamb our sacrifice

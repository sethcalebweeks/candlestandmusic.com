### Supporting Texts ###

"If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet." \
John 13:14 ESV

I have a theory that doing the dishes is about the closest thing we have to footwashing in the modern era.\
Is it the same? No. \
Is it a way to serve? Yes. \
Can we find joy in doing serving? Turn up this beat and try it!!!

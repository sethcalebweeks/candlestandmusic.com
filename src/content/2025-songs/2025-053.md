Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 
For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 
Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone? 
Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? 
If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him! \
Matthew 7:7-11 NASB95 

“If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?” \
Luke 11:13 NASB95

Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart, 
saying, “In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not respect man. 
There was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, ‘[a]Give me legal protection from my opponent.’
For a while he was unwilling; but afterward he said to himself, ‘Even though I do not fear God nor respect man, 
yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, otherwise by continually coming she will wear me out.’” 
And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge *said; 
now, will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry to Him day and night, and will He delay long over them?
I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?” \
Luke 18:1-8 NASB95

Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, 
to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. \
Ephesians 3:20-21 NASB95

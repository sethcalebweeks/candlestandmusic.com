title: 022 Lady Folly
---

He's walking down the road \
And the lady says hello \
Singing young man look my way \
You're as cute as they come \
We could have some real fun \
While my husband is away 

Oh, come with me \
Come and live your life \
We can laugh at limitations \
And ignore those obligations \
Look at me \
With your longing eyes \
Till an arrow strikes your heart \
Then you die 

He's surfing on the phone \
And she catches Him alone \
Singing young man I'm all yours \
And any time you need \
I'm guaranteed to please \
So what are you waiting for? 

Oh, come with me \
Come and live your life \
We can laugh at limitations \
And ignore those obligations \
Look at me \
With your longing eyes \
Till an arrow strikes your heart \
Then you die 

I'm quick, I'm fast \
I'm here and now \
No it won't last \
But hear me out 

Everyone is doing it so come with me \
Just cut some corners and you're on my street

Where everything is glorious and beautiful at night \
But everything is horrible if You could see the light 

But come with me \
Come and live your life \
We can laugh at limitations \
And ignore those obligations \
Look at me \
With your longing eyes \
Till an arrow strikes your heart  \
Oh come with me \
Cuz it's just this time \
We can cast off all restraints \
Leave the backpacks on the plane \
And we can free fall \
And we'll feel so high \
Till it strikes you where you are \
Then you die \
It'll strike you where you are \
Then you die

title: 015 I Still Have You
---

When the pen didn't write the story that I had in mind \
When my feet didn't go the places that I thought they might \
When it came to a close, I felt a comfort deep inside \
Cuz I, I still have You

And Your promises stand \
You're working all of this for good \
I'm still in Your hands \
My name is written in Your book \
And I, I know it's true \
I, I'm loved by You

When it didn't work out the way that I had hoped for years \
When my greatest designs were canceled by the engineer \
When my fountain of love could only be a spring of tears \
I, I still have You

And Your promises stand \
You're working all of this for good \
I'm still in Your hands \
My name is written in Your book \
And I, I know it's true \
I, I'm loved by You


And Your promises stand \
You're working all of this for good \
I'm held in Your hands \
My name is written in Your book \
And I, I know it's true \
I, I'm loved by You

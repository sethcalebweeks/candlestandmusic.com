title: 0521 Love and Truth
---

My soul don't forget to love \
Though your zeal for the Truth is good \
You fight the Nicolaitans \
But oh my soul remember when \
You fell in love, You fell in love with Him \
You need to love, You need to love again 

Love each other \
With humility of mind \
In your zeal for truth remember to be kind \
As you long to do what's right \
Look to Him and don't lose sight \
Speak the truth, filled with love, the love of Christ \
He spoke the truth, spilled His blood, and gave His life 

My soul don't deny the Truth \
Though you live where the Serpent dwells \
The lies of Nicolaitans \
You must resist, you must repent \
The Truth will come, the Truth will come them \
The Truth will come, as a sword for them 

Love each other \
With humility of mind \
In your zeal for truth remember to be kind \
As you long to do what's right \
Look to Him and don't lose sight \
Speak the truth, filled with love, the love of Christ \
He spoke the truth, spilled His blood, and gave His life

“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: \
The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, says this: \
‘I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them to be false; 
and you have perseverance and have endured for My name’s sake, and have not grown weary. 
‘But I have this against you, that you have left your first love. 
‘Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place—unless you repent. 
‘Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
‘He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. 
To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God.’ \
Revelation 2:1-7 NASB95

“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: \
The One who has the sharp two-edged sword says this: \
‘I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is; and you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. 
But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality. 
‘So you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 
‘Therefore repent; or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth. 
‘He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.’ \
Revelation 2:12-17 NASB95

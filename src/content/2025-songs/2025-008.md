title: 008 Blessed Are The Ones 
---

Blessed are the poor in spirit \
Blessed are contrite hearts \
They won't be despised \
The kingdom of the skies \
Belongs to the humble ones 

Oh blessed are the ones \
The meek shall inherit the earth \
Oh blessed are the hungry \
And those who for righteousness thirst \
Blessed are the merciful \
Blessed are the peacemakers \
Blessed are the pure in heart \
For they shall gaze on God 

Blessed are the ones who mourn \
Blessed are the ones who cry \
Written down in red \
They shall be comforted \
And soon He will wipe their eyes

Oh blessed are the ones \
The meek shall inherit the earth \
Oh blessed are the hungry \
And those who for righteousness thirst \
Blessed are the merciful \
Blessed are the peacemakers \
Blessed are the pure in heart \
For they shall gaze on God 

Blessed are the ones who suffer \
For doing what is good and right \
Their reward is great \
Who suffer for His Name \
The kingdom will be given to them \
The kingdom will be given to them

Oh blessed are the ones \
The meek shall inherit the earth \
Oh blessed are the hungry \
And those who for righteousness thirst \
Blessed are the merciful \
Blessed are the peacemakers \
Blessed are the pure in heart \
For they shall gaze on God \
They shall gaze on God

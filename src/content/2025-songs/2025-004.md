title: 004 The Church is Built on Jesus

The Church is built on Jesus \
She is His holy bride \
He makes her pure and spotless \
And for her life He died

His chosen are united \
As one in all the earth \
They share in one communion \
One Lord, one faith, one birth

But now we see division \
And wolves oppress the sheep \
Yet faithful ones are praying \
And filled with hope they weep 

The Church shall never perish \
Her Lord is on her side \
No enemy or traitor \
Can take away His bride 

Though now she faces trials \
And fights a mighty war \
Her longing eyes will see Him \
And tears will fall no more

**Supporting Hymn: The Church's One Foundation**


The Church’s one foundation \
Is Jesus Christ her Lord \
She is His new creation \
By water and the Word \
From heav’n He came and sought her \
To be His holy bride \
With His own blood He bought her \
And for her life He died

Elect from every nation \
Yet one o’er all the earth \
Her charter of salvation \
One Lord, one faith, one birth \
One holy Name she blesses \
Partakes one holy food \
And to one hope she presses \
With every grace endued 

Though with a scornful wonder \
We see her sore oppressed \
By schisms rent asunder \
By heresies distressed \
Yet saints their watch are keeping \
Their cry goes up, “How long?” \
And soon the night of weeping \
Shall be the morn of song 

The church shall never perish! \
Her dear Lord to defend \
To guide, sustain and cherish \
Is with her to the end \
Though there be those that hate her \
And false sons in her pale \
Against or foe or traitor \
She ever shall prevail

’Mid toil and tribulation \
And tumult of her war \
She waits the consummation \
Of peace for evermore \
Till, with the vision glorious \
Her longing eyes are blest \
And the great Church victorious \
Shall be the Church at rest 

Yet she on earth hath union \
With the God the Three in One \
And mystic sweet communion \
With those whose rest is won \
O happy ones and holy! \
Lord, give us grace that we \
Like them, the meek and lowly \
On high may dwell with thee

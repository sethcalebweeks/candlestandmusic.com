title: 049 My Own Rugged Cross
---

On a hill every day stand my own rugged cross, \
It promises suffering and shame; \
and it scares me to death but the one that I bless \
Would never refine me with pain

So I'll run from my own rugged cross \
When I see it I'm turning around \
I'm afraid that it's bad for my health \
When the going gets tough I lay down

"Yeah, I just need some Me time."

### Supporting Texts ###

"And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me." \
Matthew 10:38 ESV

And he said to all, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. \
Luke 9:23 ESV

 
Based on the hymn: **The Old Rugged Cross**

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, \
The emblem of suff’ring and shame; \
And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best \
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, \
Till my trophies at last I lay down; \
I will cling to the old rugged cross, \
And exchange it someday for a crown.

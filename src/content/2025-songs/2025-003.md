title: 003 Your Eyes
---

Lord I want to gaze in Your eyes \
And see what You see in me \
Search me and know my heart \
Let me grieve what You grieve in me \
Let me grieve what You grieve in me

Let Your eyes look upon me \
Though they flame like a torch \
You give grace to the humble \
There is life where Your light shines forth \
There's life where Your light shines forth

Let me look in Your eyes \
Let me know Your heart \
Let it change who I am \
And make me as You are \
Oh make me as You are

Let me look in Your eyes \
Let me know Your heart \
Let it change who I am \
And make me as You are \
Oh make me as You are

Lead the way everlasting \
Guide my wandering feet \
Give me grace till I'm standing \
With Your eyes looking back at me \
With Your eyes looking back at me

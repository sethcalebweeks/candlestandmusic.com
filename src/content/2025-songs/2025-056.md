title: 056 Remember Him
---

When Abraham divided up the rams \
And laid a path to make a covenant \
He never thought the highest of all kings \
Would walk alone and bear the curse it brings 

But so it was, a covenant was made \
And God alone established it by grace \
For if the terms should break on either side \
The one who walked alone would need to die 

Remember Him \
Remember Him \
The highest of all kings \
The deepest of all friends \
Who bore our suffering \
And loved us to the end 

At supper time, before it all began \
He took the bread and broke it in his hands \
As he would be broken in the morn \
As he would be lifted up and torn 

Remember Him \
Remember Him \
The highest of all kings \
The deepest of all friends \
Who bore our suffering \
And loved us to the end 

With the cup he made a covenant \
And kept the one, he made to Abraham \
To the end, He showed His faithful love \
And now we drink forgiveness in His blood 

Remember Him \
Remember Him \
The highest of all kings \
The deepest of all friends \
Who bore our suffering \
And loved us so

Remember Him \
Remember Him \
The highest of all kings \
The deepest of all friends \
Who bore our sufferings \
And loved us to the end

And I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. 
Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. \

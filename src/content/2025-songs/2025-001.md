title: 001 Blessed Are Those Who Mourn
---

Father of mercies\
God of all comfort comfort me

Father of mercies\
God of all comfort comfort me 

Blessed are those who mourn\
Blessed are those who mourn\
Blessed are those who mourn\
Blessed are those who mourn\
\
Oh Lord who lights the dark\
And calls us from the tomb\
You heal our broken hearts\
And bind our deepest wounds\
You ordained every day of my life\
Every wave of this stormy sea\
As I read in these pages tonight\
I will wait for Your goodness as I weep\
I wait for Your goodness as I weep

Blessed are those who mourn\
Blessed are those who mourn\
Blessed are those who mourn\
They will be comforted\
Blessed are those who mourn\
They will be comforted\

(Note: I repeat this a few to many times and lose the tempo!)

---

It's hard to be somebody you're not \
It's hard to live afraid \
It's hard to trust when everyone drops \
The heart you give away 

But what if you were loved by the One who made you? \
What if you were held by hands that made the world? \
He made the world \
And what if He said "I won't forsake you"? \
What if His words could never ever fail? \
They never will 

And you don't need to be somebody you're not \
You don't need to be afraid \
If you know you're loved by the Son of God \
Your life is totally made

Trust, oh trust, yeah trust in Him \
And peace will cover your mind \
Trust, oh trust, yeah trust in Him \
Believe He's really that kind 

I am loved by the One who made me \
I am held by the hands that made the world \
He made the world \
And He really did say "I won't forsake you" \
None of His words can ever ever fail \
They never will 

So trust, oh trust, yeah trust in Him \
And peace will cover your mind \
Oh trust, oh trust, yeah trust in Him \
Believe He's really that kind 

I am loved by the One who made me \
I am held by the hands that made the world \
He made the world \
And He really did say "I won't forsake you" \
None of His words could ever ever fail \
They never will 

So why are you anxious? \
Why do you fear? \
Why do you trust yourself so much? \
Let me remind you \
What defines you \

title: 064 A Prayer For Travelers
---

Oh Lord, protect the travelers \
Bless them on their way \
Guard them from the evil one \
And keep, oh keep them safe \
From harm that could befall them \
From accidents unseen \
From dangers all around them \
Wherever they may be 

Oh, Father go before them \
Lord, prepare their way \
Set a guard behind them \
And keep, oh keep them safe \
From fears that rise within them \
From all anxiety \
From doubting their Provider \
Whatever they may need 

Oh keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them safe in Jesus' name \
Keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them in Jesus

Oh, Savior please go with them \
And be with them always \
Direct their every footstep \
And keep, oh keep them safe \
From perils in the darkness \
From every enemy \
From now until forever \
Wherever You may lead

Oh keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them safe in Jesus' name \
Keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them in Jesus

Keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them safe in Jesus' name \
Oh, keep them safe \
Keep them safe \
Keep them in Jesus' name

For I was ashamed to request from the king troops and horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, because we had said to the king, “The hand of our God is favorably disposed to all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those who forsake Him.” 
So we fasted and sought our God concerning this matter, and He listened to our entreaty. \
Ezra 8:21-23 NASB95

“While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. \
John 17:12 NASB95

teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” \

title: 052 The Door
---

There's an endless mansion to explore \
Full of empty rooms that promise more \
But there's one your soul is aching for \
And the King is knocking at the door 

While the rest of the house is cold and gray \
There's a door with another world inside \
While the rest of mansion's in decay \
There's a door to the kingdom of skies \
There's a room with the King of Kings inside 

There's a room in the mansion full of light \
Full of gold and gems of every kind \
It's an outpost of the coming life \
With a river flowing deep and wide 

While the rest of the house is emptiness \
There's a door to a garden paradise \
While the rest of mansion leads to less \
There's a door to a more abundant life \
There's a room where the greatest treasures hide 

There's so much more \
There's so much more \
Behind the door \
Behind the door \
The door that every heart is aching for 

There's a room in the mansion full of love \
Full of food and fellowship restored \
It's a taste of the city yet to come \
Where the bride is always with her Lord

While the rest of the house is dark as night \
There's a door fighting emanating rays \
While the rest of mansion longs for light \
There's a door to the source of endless day \
There's a room that's illumined by His face
There's a room that's illumined by His face

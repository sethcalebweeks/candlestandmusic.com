title: 018 I Don't Need To Rescue Isaac
---

I don't need to worry \
I don't need to fear \
I just need to trust Your hand

I don't need to murder \
I don't need to steal \
I don't need to covet what my neighbor has

I don't need to lust \
And I don't need to lie \
I just need to do whatever You command

I don't need to worry \
I don't need to fear \
I just need to trust Your hand

I don't need to rescue Isaac from the alter \
I just need to trust You can \
I don't need to help You carry out Your promise \
I just need to raise my hand

You provide the lamb \
You provide the lamb \
As I trust in You \
You provide the lamb \
As I trust in You \
You provide the lamb \
As I trust in You \
You provide the lamb \
As I trust in You \
You provide the lamb \
As I trust in You \
You provide the lamb \
As I trust...

Oh I don't need to rescue Isaac from the alter \
I just need to trust You can \
I don't need to help You carry out Your promise \
I just need to raise my hand

You'll raise the dead if that's what it takes \
So I will raise my hand \
You'll raise the dead if that's what it takes \
So I will raise my hand 

And I don't need to rescue Isaac from the alter \
I just need to trust You can \
I don't need to help You carry out Your promise \
I just need to raise my hand

And You provide the lamb \
Oh, You provide the lamb \
As I trust in You \
You provide the lamb \
As I trust in You \
You provide the lamb \
Lord, You are the lamb

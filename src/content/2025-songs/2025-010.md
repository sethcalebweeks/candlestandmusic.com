title: 010 Eyes to See
---

They were blind to see Him when He walked their streets \
Deaf to hear Him when they heard Him speak \
They did not get it till the Spirit came \
A rushing wind and a fiery flame

O Spirit fill our eyes to see \
Your glory and Your majesty \
The King of Kings is here with us \
So wake us from our sleep 

And though we gather every week by week \
We're bound to miss Him if we cannot see \
Without the Spirit we are deaf and blind \
Lord open up our hearts and minds

O Spirit fill our eyes to see \
Your glory and Your majesty \
The King of Kings is here with us \
So wake us from our sleep \
O Spirit fill our eyes to see \
Your glory and Your majesty \
The King of Kings is here with us \
So wake us from our sleep

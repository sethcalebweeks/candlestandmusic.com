title: 070 Your Love is My Song
---

The Lord is my light and my salvation \
Whom shall I fear in this world? \
You are my stronghold in times of trouble \
Of whom shall I be afraid?

So I will wait on You my God \
My hope is in You alone \
And I will fix my eyes on You \
And this will be my song

And I say \
Heeey eey ehhh, Oohhh, Heeey eey ehhh \
You love me so \
Heeey eey ehhh, Oooh, Heeey eey ehhh \
Your love goes on and on and on

I lift my eyes up unto the mountains \
Where does my help come from? \
My help comes from You, Maker of heaven \
Creator of earth

So I will wait on You my God \
My hope is in You alone \
And I will fix my eyes on You \
And this will be my song

And I say \
Heeey eey ehhh, Oohhh, Heeey eey ehhh \
You love me so \
Heeey eey ehhh, Oooh, Heeey eey ehhh \
Your love goes on and on and
        
In the blazing fire, I won’t be burned \
In the raging river, I won’t be drowned \
In the rushing waters, You will be with me

In the blazing fire, I won’t be burned \
In the raging river, I won’t be drowned \
In the rushing waters, You will be with me

Heeey eey ehhh, Oohhh, Heeey eey ehhh \
You love me so \
Heeey eey ehhh, Oooh, Heeey eey ehhh \
Your love goes on and on and

In the blazing fire, I won’t be burned \
In the raging river, I won’t be drowned \
In the rushing waters, You will be with me

In the blazing fire, I won’t be burned \
In the raging river, I won’t be drowned \
In the rushing waters, You will be with me

So I will wait on You my God \
My hope is in You alone \
And I will fix my eyes on You \
And this will be my song

And I say \
Heeey eey ehhh, Oohhh, Heeey eey ehhh \
You love me so \
Heeey eey ehhh, Oooh, Heeey eey ehhh \
Your love goes on and on and on

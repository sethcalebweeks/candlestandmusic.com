We are drawn to what is holy \
We long to be divine \
We strive to be our maker \
And to live as we define

But only He is holy \
There's only one I Am \
For Babylon is fallen \
And the tower will not stand

We all want to be like God \
We all want to be like God \
We all want to be like God \
Whether we like Him or not \
But the only way to do it \
The only way to life \
Is not the flesh pursusing \
But the Spirit of Christ

We sought it back in eden \
We took and ate the fruit \
Reaching for His likeness \
Then hiding from His view 

But the very thing we longed for \
The very thing we craved \
We clawed for in the garden \
But on the cross He gave

We all want to be like God \
We all want to be like God \
We all want to be like God \
Whether we like Him or not \
But the only way to do it \
The only way to life \
Is not the flesh pursusing \
But the Spirit of Christ

Destroying what divides us \
And rending flesh and blood \
He raised us in His likeness \
Uniting us as one

With ever growing glory \
We gaze on Him by faith \
He shapes us to His likeness \
Until we see His face

Then we'll be like God \
Then we'll be like God \
Then we'll be like God \
And we'll like Him a lot \
But the only way to do it \
The only way to life \
Is not the flesh pursusing \
But the Spirit of Christ

Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.

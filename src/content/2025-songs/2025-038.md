title: 038 Salvation Belongs to Our God
---

Salvation belongs to our God \
Who's seated on the throne \
And to the Lamb \
Be blessing "Amen" \
Glory to God alone 

We wash our robes in the blood of the Lamb \
He makes them white as snow \
The Lamb is our Shepherd we shall not want \
He leads where the waters flow \
We shelter in Him alone 

Salvation is not in ourselves \
Not in the strength of man \
Feeble and frail \
We're bound to fail \
Without the saving Lamb

We wash our robes in the blood of the Lamb \
He makes them white as snow \
The Lamb is our Shepherd we shall not want \
He leads where the waters flow \
We shelter in Him alone 

Salvation belongs to our God \
Who's seated on the throne \
And to the Lamb \
Be blessing "Amen" \
Glory to God alone \
Glory to God alone

"After this I looked, and there was a vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language, which no one could number, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. 
They were clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice:

Salvation belongs to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!

All the angels stood around the throne, and along with the elders and the four living creatures they fell facedown before the throne and worshiped God, saying,

Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.

Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these people in white robes, and where did they come from?”

I said to him, “Sir, you know.”

Then he told me: These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\
For this reason they are before the throne of God, \
and they serve him day and night in his temple.\
The one seated on the throne will shelter them: \
They will no longer hunger; \
they will no longer thirst; \
the sun will no longer strike them, \
nor will any scorching heat. \
For the Lamb who is at the center of the throne will shepherd them; \
he will guide them to springs of the waters of life, \
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."

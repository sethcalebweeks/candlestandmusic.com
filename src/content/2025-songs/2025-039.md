title: 039 May They Rememeber
---

Let them forget the rest of me \
Let them know the best of me \
Was really You, the light of Christ in me \
Shining through, dim as it may be 

May they remember, may they remember \
Christ in me \
May they remember, may they treasure \
The Christ in me You let them see \
Some kindness, some patience \
Some faithful love \
And the grace that comes from You

Every day I painted You \
Don't give them a tainted view \
Of who You are through who they saw in me \
Cuz who You are is not the whole of me \
(But let it be!) 

May they remember, may they remember \
Christ in me \
May they remember, may they treasure \
The Christ in me You let them see \
Some kindness, some patience \
Some faithful love \
And the grace that comes from You

Please don't \
Please don't \
Please don't let them misremember \
Cuz all the worst was me \
And all the best was You \
Let 'em hang the worst on me \
But love the glimpse of You 

May they remember, may they remember \
Christ in me \
May they remember, may they treasure \
The Christ in me You let them see \
Some kindness, some patience \
Some faithful love \
And the grace that comes from You

Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. 
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. \

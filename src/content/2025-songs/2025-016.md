title: 016 Till The Day We're Healed
---

We carry pain despite our hope \
A pain we can't erase \
We trust and know promise holds \
But still we have to wait

The pain we must acknowledge here \
The pain we can't ignore \
But pain along with all our tears \
So soon will be no more

He took our pain \
He bore our sins \
He knows the way that it feels \
He gives us faith \
To trust in Him \
Until the day we are healed \
One day we'll be healed

We do not risk forgetfulness \
For what we always feel \
But tell your soul: "remember this" \
"Our hope is just as real"

The truth of pain we've come to know \
It doesn't need our faith \
But things unseen, unheard, unknown \
They call souls to wait 

He took our pain \
He bore our sins \
He knows the way that it feels \
He gives us faith \
To trust in Him \
Until the day we are healed \
One day we'll be healed

We will have no pain \
When we see His face

He took our pain \
He bore our sins \
He knows the way that it feels \
He gives us faith \
To trust in Him \
Until the day we are healed \
One day we'll be healed

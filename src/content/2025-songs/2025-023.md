title: 023 Lady Wisdom
---

Through the calm and through the chaos \
Hear the voice of wisdom sing \
She calling us to share in all the goodness that she brings \
But lady folly's louder and attractive to our eyes \
So we turn from lady wisdom at the cost of our own lives 

But blessed, oh happy are the ones \
Who heed the voice of wisdom, leaving folly and her fun \
Oh blessed, are those who choose her ways \
She gives them wealth, and life, and peace, and goodness all her days \
She gives them wealth, and life, and peace, and goodness all her days 

She is far beyond all riches \
Like a treasure we can't mine \
She's always calling out for us to seek until we find \
But lady folly's easy and convenient as can be \
So we turn from lady wisdom to a life of poverty 

But blessed, oh happy are the ones \
Who heed the voice of wisdom, leaving folly and her fun \
Oh blessed, are those who choose her ways \
She gives them wealth, and life, and peace, and goodness all her days \
She gives them wealth, and life, and peace, and goodness all her days 

She says come! \
Eat my food and drink my wine \
Oh come! \
Leave your foolish ways behind \
And come! \
Keep on waiting at my door \
And You'll start to walk with wisdom when You start to fear the Lord \
You will start to walk with wisdom when You start to fear the Lord 

Oh come! \
Eat my food and drink my wine \
Oh come! \
Leave your foolishness behind \
And come! \
Keep on waiting at my door \
And You'll start to walk with wisdom when You start to fear the Lord \
You will start to walk with wisdom when You start to fear the Lord

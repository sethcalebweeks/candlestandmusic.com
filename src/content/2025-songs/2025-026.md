title: 026 Leaning on Your Grace
---

I'm leaning on the grace You ordained for me \
I'm trusting You with faith cuz it's hard to see \
How You're gonna turn it all around \
And use it all for good someway somehow 

I'm leaning the grace that I must receive \
I'm leaning on Your strength cuz today I'm weak \
Father, You would You turn the raging tide \
And redeem the worst days of my life 

And turn it all for good \
Turn it for Your glory \
Turn it all for good \
Like the greatest stories

I'm leaning on the grace You ordained for me \
I'm trusting You with faith cuz it's hard to see \
How You're gonna turn this one around \
Use it all for good someway somehow 

I'm leaning the grace that I must receive \
I'm leaning on Your strength cuz today I'm weak \
Father, You would You turn the raging tide \
And redeem the worst days of my life 

And turn it all for good \
Turn it for Your glory \
Turn it all for good \
Like the greatest stories

And turn it all for good \
Turn it for Your glory \
Turn it all for good \
Like the greatest stories

title: 033 Song of Moses - Part I
---

Hear O heavens and hear O earth \
The song of Moses and sacred words \
Speech is pouring from him like rain \
It starts with lifting God's great name

For He is just in all His ways \
He is perfect with no mistakes \
A faithful God of righteousness \
But oh His people are so much less 

A perverse generation \
They acted so corrupt \
Is this your repayment? \
To Him who raised you up? 

Go ask your dad \
Oh remember days gone past \
He will tell you God most high \
Split the nations far and wide 

But He chose them as His own \
In a desert wilderness \
And He circled them with love \
Like an Eagle in his nest 

With no other God to guide \
They were carried on His wings \
They were soaring on the heights \
And they ate the finest things 

They drank honey from the rock \
There was oil, there was wine \
Curds and milk right from the flock \
And all they needed was supplied

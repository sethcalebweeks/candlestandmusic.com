title: 021 A Prayer for Wounded Hearts
---

Lord I kneel before Your throne \
And come to You for grace \
To bind the wounds I cannot heal \
And mend the hearts that ache \
Look and see what happened here \
I lift my gaze to You \
Waiting for Your hand of grace \
To touch and heal our wounds

Lord where I have done the wrong \
And where my words brought harm \
Lord forgive me, mend the wrong \
I lift my helpless arms \
One who calms the wind and waves \
Come speak your words of life \
Calm the storm inside our souls \
And bid our fears goodbye

Father now I come to You \
Remember Your great love \
Father would you raise the dead \
Restore and build us up \
Father I am asking You \
To raise us to Your throne \
Let us see how wide and deep \
Your love for us will go \
Let us see how wide and deep \
Your love for us will go

title: 046 A Concerning Foundation
---

A concerning foundation, is built on the sand \
But the beachfront looks awesome so buy up some land \
What more can I say, but ignore all His Words \
You’ll be safely surrounded, just follow the herd

Fear not, in temptation, he made you this way \
When desire is calling it must be okay \
Deny all the warnings, interpret anew \
When the Word is concerning, conform it to you

“Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. 
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.
Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 
The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and great was its fall.” \
Matthew 7:24-27 NASB95

Based on the hymn: **How Firm a Foundation**

How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, \
is laid for your faith in God's excellent Word! \
What more can be said than to you God hath said, \
to you who for refuge to Jesus have fled? 

"Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed, \
for I am thy God, and will still give thee aid; \
I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, \
upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.

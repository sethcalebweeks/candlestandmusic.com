Precious in the sight of the Lord \
Is the death of His godly ones \
Oh, how blessed are those who rest \
And rise to hear "well done" 

Precious in the sight of the Lord \
Is the death of His godly ones \
Oh, how blessed are those who rest \
And rise to hear "well done" 

Well done, well done \
Enter your Master's joy \
We are grieving here below \
But you are safely home

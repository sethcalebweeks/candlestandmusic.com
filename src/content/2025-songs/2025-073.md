Lord I trust Your unfailing love \
In the depths of my lonely heart \
You will be, You will be enough \
And Your light will erase my dark 

Even though I'm all alone \
You are here, You are here with me \
I will sing Your praise as I wait for Your grace \
To heal and make me whole

I confess that I cannot save \
Cannot heal with my own two hands \
So I lift, oh I lift my gaze \
To the only One who can 

Even though I'm all alone \
You are here, You are here with me \
I will sing Your praise as I wait for Your grace \
To heal and make me whole

I put my trust in You \
I place my hope in You \
I give my love to You \
Jesus You're my Lord \
Jesus You're my Lord 

Even though I'm all alone \
You are here, You are here with me \
I will sing Your praise as I wait for Your grace \
To heal and make me whole \
Come heal and make me whole

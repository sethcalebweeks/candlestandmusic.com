title: 067 A Prayer for Wisdom
---

Lord, Your foolishness is wiser than man \
I asked to use it on my school exams \
And You provided me a 4.0 \
A little of Your foolishness, I'm good to go

Lord, give me wisdom \
Open my mind \
To know the right decision \
And to know the right time \
Lord, give me wisdom \
Wisdom from above \
No matter the decision \
Give me wisdom and love

Lord, how I need Your wisdom right now \
I'm asking please, would You send some down? \
Cuz my decisions touch a thousand lives \
A little of Your wisdom and we'll be alright

Lord, give me wisdom \
Open my mind \
To know the right decision \
And to know the right time \
Lord, give me wisdom \
Wisdom from above \
No matter the decision \
Give me wisdom and love

Lord, You're the wisest, knowin' all things \
But I am blind in almost everything \
So give me wisdom as I ask of You \
A lot of love and wisdom, and a lot of grace too \
A lot of love and wisdom, and a lot of grace too

Lord, give me wisdom \
Open my mind \
To know the right decision \
And to know the right time \
Lord, give me wisdom \
Wisdom from above \
No matter the decision \
Give me wisdom and love \
No matter the decision \
Give me wisdom and love

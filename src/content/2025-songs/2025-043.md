title: 043 Great is My Faithfulness
---

Great is my faithfulness, to God my Father \
There is no shadow of turning with me \
Praise God I’m not like those needing compassion \
My faith is strong and it ever shall be

Great is my faithfulness \
Great is my faithfulness \
Morning by morning I’m good as can be \
All I have needed my prayers have provided \
Great is my faithfulness \
God must love me

And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt:
“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.’
But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, the sinner!’
I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.” \
Luke 18:9-14 NASB95

Based on the hymn: **Great is Thy Faithfulness** \
Thomas O. Chisholm (1923)

Great is thy faithfulness, O God, my Father; \
There is no shadow of turning with thee. \
Thou changest not, thy compassions, they fail not; \
As thou hast been, thou forever wilt be.

Great is thy faithfulness, \
Great is thy faithfulness, \
Morning by morning new mercies I see. \
All I have needed thy hand hast provided; \
Great is thy faithfulness, \
Lord unto me.

title: 068 He Forgave You
---

My soul, reflect upon your God \
On His power and His faithful love \
All the days He gave you daily bread \
All the blessings rained upon your head 

He forgave you \
All your sins \
And raised you \
Up with Him \
An heir with Christ \
You died and He's your life \
So take delight in Him 

My soul, cling tightly to your God \
Return and thank Him for His love \
With awe and wonder break the bread \
For His blood is covering your head 

He forgave you \
All your sins \
And raised you \
Up with Him \
An heir with Christ \
You died and He's your life \
So take delight in Him 

Christian know that He is honest \
Don't forget His promise \
Don't forget His love \
Christian you have been forgiven \
Set apart to live in \
Union with the Son \
Set your mind on things above \
Our inheritance will come \
With glory of the One \
Who is shining like the sun \
So get ready for the day \
Put aside your former ways \
And prepare to see His face \
Standing breathless and amazed \
Cuz you know that...

He forgave you \
All your sins \
And raised you \
Up with Him \
An heir with Christ \
You died and He's your life \
So take delight in Him

title: 013 Transform My Mind
---

Transform my mind till I think like You \
Transform my will till I do what You do \
Show me the depth of Your endless love \
Fill me with all of You

Blessed are those who turn from the road \
where the godless love to be \
But take their delight as they read day and night \
in the law of liberty 

I wanna be that tree \
Where my roots drink from the stream \
Growing fruit abundantly \
And my leaves are evergreen 

Transform my mind till I think like You \
Transform my will till I do what You do \
Show me the depth of Your endless love \
Fill me with all of You \
(repeat 2x)

There's so many voices directing our choices \
"Do not be deceived" \
Cuz morals go down when we are surrounded \
by godless company

I wanna be that tree \
Where my roots drink from the stream \
Growing fruit abundantly \
And my leaves are evergreen 

Transform my mind till I think like You \
Transform my will till I do what You do \
Show me the depth of Your endless love \
Fill me with all of You \
(repeat 3x + tag last) 

There's so many voices directing our choices \
"Do not be deceived" \

### Supporting Verses ###

"How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,\
Nor stand in the path of sinners,\
Nor sit in the seat of scoffers! \
But his delight is in the law of the LORD, \
And in His law he meditates day and night. \
He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, \
Which yields its fruit in its season \
And its leaf does not wither; \
And in whatever he does, he prospers." \
Psalm 1:1-3

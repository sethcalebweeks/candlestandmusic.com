title: 034 When You Don't Feel Like Forgiving
---

When you don't feel like forgiving \
When you don't have what it takes \
Survival mode keeps you living \
Accusing them keeps you safe 

See the man upon the cross \
Innocent abd so abused \
Lifting up a prayer for us \
(Forgive them) they don't know the things they do 

It takes more than the strength inside of us \
To be crucified and live \
But with Jesus Christ alive in us \
Who's able to forgive \
He's able to forgive 

He forgave us \
He forgave us \
He forgave us \
He forgave us

It takes more than the strength inside of us \
To be crucified and live \
It's the risen Christ alive in us \
Who's able to forgive \
Now we're able to forgive 

I forgive you \
I forgive you

He forgave me \
He forgave me

So I forgive you \
I forgive you

title: 005 A Weary Prayer 
---

Holy Father I come to You \
And ask for daily bread \
With all my sorrows and all my wounds \
Oh lift my weary head

Take the weight of the cares I hold \
Take my burdens and heavy load \
Show Your power where I am weak \
With grace sufficient for all I need

Abba Father I come to You \
And bow before Your throne \
With thoughts and feelings too deep for words \
Oh hear the Spirit groan

Take the weight of the cares I hold \
Take my burdens and heavy load \
Show Your power where I am weak \
With grace sufficient for all I need

Gracious Father I bless Your name \
And trust Your hidden plans \
To weave our sorrows and spin our pain \
To beauty in Your hands

Take the weight of the cares I hold \
Take my burdens and heavy load \
Show Your power where I am weak \
With grace sufficient for all I need

**Supporting Verses**

In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words; and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. \
And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. \
Romans 8:26-28

“Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest." \
Matthew 11:28

And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. \
2 Corinthians 12:9

title: 072 He is Lord (Let the Mind of Christ)
---

Let the mind of Christ be in me \
Let me share His servant heart \
Putting other’s needs above me \
Even when the choice is hard

Though an equal with the Father \
Christ the one and only Son \
Freely gave His rights and honor \
And became a slave for us

He is Lord \
He is Lord \
He is risen from the dead \
And He is Lord \
Every knee shall bow \
Every tongue confess \
That Jesus Christ is Lord

Humble as a mortal human \
Bending even lower still \
Dying on a cross He'd carried \
He obeyed His Father’s will

Therefore God has now exalted \
Jesus over every name \
Every tongue will give Him glory \
Jesus Christ is Lord they'll say

For He is Lord \
He is Lord \
He is risen from the dead \
And He is Lord \
Every knee shall bow \
Every tongue confess \
That Jesus Christ is Lord

He is Lord \
He is Lord \
He is risen from the dead \
And He is Lord \
Every knee shall bow \
Every tongue confess \
That Jesus Christ is Lord

### Supporting Verses ###

“Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, 
but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; 
do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. 
Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, 
did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, 
and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance as a man, 
He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 
For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, 
so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 
and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” \
Philippians 2:3-11 NASB95

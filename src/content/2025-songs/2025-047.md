title: 047 Blessed Insurance
---

Blessed insurance, everything's fine \
Who needs a Savior with coverage like mine? \
Auto and home are all in good hands \
Even my health is held in a plan 

They will restore me when life goes wrong \
Though it's a phone call half a year long \
They will restore me when life goes wrong \
Or they'll ignore me till I am gone

"Mr. Sarx?" \
"Mr. Sarx?" 

"Yeah, yeah, I'm still here."

"Hello, uh, yes..." \
"your, your claim is not actually covered under your current plan."

"What do you mean it's not covered?!?!"

### Supporting Texts ###

Thus says the LORD, â€œCursed is the man who trusts in mankind \
And makes flesh his strength, \
And whose heart turns away from the LORD. \
Jeremiah 17:5 NASB95

Based on the hymn: **Blessed Assurance**

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! \
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine! \
Heir of salvation, purchase of God, \
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood. 

This is my story, this is my song, \
Praising my Savior all the day long; \
This is my story, this is my song, \
Praising my Savior all the day long.

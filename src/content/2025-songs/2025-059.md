title: 059 Yearn for You
---

O God, You are my God \
And I will search for You \
And worship You \
O God, You are my God \
My soul thirsts for You \
I yearn for You

In a dry and weary land \
There's no water where I am \
But I've seen You in Your dwelling place \
Seen Your power and Your grace

Your love \
Is better than life \
So my lips will praise and bless You \
For as long as I'm alive

I will lift up my hands in Your name \
My soul is satisfied \
With joyful lips I'll praise You

O God, You are my God \
And I will search for You \
And worship You \
O God, You are my God \
My soul thirsts for You \
I yearn for You

In the watches of the night \
You're the shelter where I hide \
In the shadow of Your wings \
There's a joy that makes me sing 

My soul \
Clings fast \
Holding You as You uphold me with Your mighty hand 

And the ones who are hunting me down \
Will fall to the groud \
But my joy in You abounds

O God, You are my God \
And I will search for You \
And worship You \
O God, You are my God \
My soul thirsts for You \
I yearn for You

O God, You are my God \
My soul thirsts for You \
I yearn for You

In that dry and weary land \
There's no water where I am \
But I've seen You in Your dwelling place \
Seen Your glory and Your grace

Your love \
Is better than life \
So my lips will praise and bless You \
For as long as I'm alive

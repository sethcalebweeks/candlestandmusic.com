title: 006 If We Love One Another 
---

If we love one another \
we have crossed the great divide \
Out of death, out of darkness into life \
If we love one another then we truly live \
Even though we are daily called to die 

Let us love (let us love) \
One another (one another) \
Even if (even if) \
We die (we die) \
If we love (if we love) \
As He loved (as He loved) \
We will share in His resurrection life \
We will share in His resurrection life 

If we don't love each other \
we may seem to be alive \
But there's always a shadow in our eyes \
If we don't love our brothers we abide in death  \
Till we die to ourselves and come alive

Let us love (let us love) \
One another (one another) \
Even if (even if) \
We die (we die) \
If we love (if we love) \
As He loved (as He loved) \
We will share in His resurrection life \
We will share in His resurrection life 

He said love one another \
in the way that I loved You \
Then He took up His cross and gave His life \
In this love Jesus suffered, in this love He died \
But this love leads to resurrection life \
Oh this love leads to resurrection life

Let us love (let us love) \
One another (one another) \
Even if (even if) \
We die (we die) \
If we love (if we love) \
As He loved (as He loved) \
We will share in His resurrection life \
We will share in His resurrection life \
We will share in His resurrection life

Why, O my soul \
Are you down? \
Down so low? \
Why so disquieted within me? \
Put, put your hope \
In your Savior and your God \
I, I will yet give Him praise 


Why, O my soul \
Are you down? \
Down so low? \
Why so disquieted within me? \
Put, put your hope \
In your Savior and your God \
I, I will yet give Him praise

title: 019 I Will Sing of the Kingdom
---

We're longing for a nation \
We're aching for a king \
Who'll reign with truth and justice \
And bring the good times in \
He'll bring the good times in

I'll sing of the kingdom that will have no end \
No more votes, no more lies \
No more poverty or crime \
I will sing of kingdom till the King will come \
Bringing justice and abundant life 

We're citizens of heaven \
Ambassador below \
We'll honor those who rule us \
But bow before one throne \
We'll bow before one throne 

I'll sing of the kingdom that will have no end \
No more votes, no more lies \
No more poverty or crime \
I will sing of kingdom till the King will come \
Bringing justice and abundant life 

(Someone could help me out with a better solo here!)

I'll sing of the kingdom that will have no end \
No more votes, no more lies \
No more poverty or crime \
I will sing of kingdom till the King will come \
Bringing justice and abundant life \
Bringing justice and abundant life

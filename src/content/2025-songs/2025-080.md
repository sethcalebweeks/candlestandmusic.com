title: 080 The Lord Will Give Us Peace
---

I'm leaning on the Lord to establish peace \
I'm leaning on the Lord who performed our works \
Trusing in His steadfast love, whatever may come \
The Lord will give us peace

I'm leaning on the hand of the Lord Most High \
I'm leaning on the Lamb, that God provides \
Even in the darkest night, He'll be our light
The Lord will give us peace

For He has done it all \
He has done it all so well \
Even from the very first day \
It all was ordained \
The Lord will give us peace

I'm leaning on the Lord who keeps His Word \
I'm leaning on the Lord who loved us first \
Trusing Him with every care, we lift in prayer \
The Lord will give us peace

For He has done it all \
He has done it all so well \
Even from the very first day \
It all was ordained \
The Lord will give us peace \
The Lord will give us peace \
The Lord will give us peace

AmazingÂ faith, how sweet the sound \
that saved a saint like me! \

and now I finally see

### Supporting Texts ###

For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
Ephesians 2:8-9 ESV

Based on the hymn: **Amazing Grace**

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound \
that saved a wretch like me! \
I once was lost, but now am found, \
was blind, but now I see.

John Newton (1779)

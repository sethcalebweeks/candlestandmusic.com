title: 065 The Song of Moses (Full)
---

Hear oh heavens and hear oh earth \
The Lord is just in all His works \
But oh His people are so corrupt \
Despite His overwhelming love

He found them in a desert \
In the howling wilderness \
And He cared for all His people \
Like an eagle in its nest 

Then he bore them on His wings \
Made them ride upon the heights \
Till they ate the finest things \
And the rock was their supply


But they rejected their perfect Rock \
And spurned the one Creator God \
They worshipped demons and empty gods \
And all allegiance they forgot 

He saw it and He spurned them \
Then He said "I'll hide my face" \
And the fire of His anger \
Set the mountains all ablaze 

I will heap on them misfortunes \
Bringing famine, plague, and sword \
From the youngest to the oldest \
Till they almost are no more


Oh if only they understood \
And saw with wisdom all they should \
But now like venom from deadly snakes \
Their making wine from Sodom's grapes 

It's locked inside His store house \
And the day of wrath draws nigh \
He will vindicate His people \
Saying "vengeance is mine 

Tell me where are all your gods? \
Let them save you if they can \
Can't you see that I am He \
No one rescues from my hand"


I have wounded and I will heal \
No other god is even real \
I put to death and I make alive \
Oh can't You see that it is I 

I will render vengeance \
When I sharpen up my sword \
I'll repay the ones who hate me \
As I live forevermore 

O rejoice with all His servants \
For He will avenge their blood \
And his enemies deserve it \
He will cleanse the land and us

title: 041 What Was He Feeling?
---

What was He feeling? \
As the Just One stood accused \
What was He feeling? \
At their mockery of truth \
What was He feeling? \
Right before the rooster crowed \
How did it feel to watch His friends all let Him go?

What was He feeling? \
What was Jesus going through? \
How did He manage \
Such injustice and abuse? \
What was driving Him that day? \
A force that's greater such pain \
It must be love \
For the Father He obeyed \
It must be love \
For bride He came to save 

What was He feeling? \
As the King of Kings was crowned \
What was He feeling? \
As the mocking soldiers bowed \
What was He feeling? \
Right when Judas kissed His face \
How did it feel to share His bread and be betrayed? 

What was He feeling? \
What was Jesus going through? \
How did He manage \
Such injustice and abuse? \
What was driving Him that day? \
A force that's greater such pain \
It must be love \
For the Father He obeyed \
It must be love \
For bride He came to save 

And how did it feel \
As the nails drove in? \
Oh, how did it feel \
As He bore my sin? \
How did it feel \
To be turned away \
By the Father He loved \
As He still obeyed? \ 
By the Father He loved \
As He still obeyed 

This is the Lamb \
This is the Lamb of God \
We honor Him 

This is the Son \
This is the Son of God \
We worship Him

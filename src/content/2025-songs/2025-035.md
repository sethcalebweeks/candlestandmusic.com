The LORD descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the name of the LORD. \
Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, \
“The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness...

Lord You are merciful \
Lord You are merciful \
Lord You are merciful \
Lord You are merciful

That is who You are \
That’s the image of Your Son \
That is who You are \
May it be who we become

Lord You are full of grace \
Lord You are slow to anger \
Lord You are full of grace \
Lord You are slow to anger
 
That is who You are \
That’s the image of Your Son \
That is who You are \
Let it be who we become

Lord You are abounding \
In steadfast love and faithfulness \
Lord You are abounding \
In steadfast love and faithfulness

That is who You are \
That’s the image of Your Son \
That is who You are \
Let it be who we become
	
"Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship"

That is who You are \
That’s the image of Your Son \
That is who You are \
May it be who we become
  
As Your daughters and Your sons \
We behold You now by faith \
Till we shine like Moses’ face \
And Your glory will increase \
For the cross is where we see \
All these attributes displayed \
For You lifted all our blame \
And You bore it on You back \
Oh, we worship You for...

That is who You are \
That’s the image of Your Son \
That is who You are \
May it be who we become

That is who You are \
That’s the image of Your Son \
That is who You are \
May it be who we become

title: 012 Bread Today
---

Lord, You gave me bread today \
And I will give You thanks \
Cuz all I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ

For food that fills our souls \
And shelter when it's cold \
For filling my tank when low \
And bringing me safely home

Lord, You gave me bread today \
And I will give You thanks \
Cuz all I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ

For life and health and peace \
And clothes to cover me \
And every little thing I need \
You've given abundantly

Lord, You gave me bread today \
And I wanna give You thanks \
Cuz all I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ \
All I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ \
Oh all I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ \
All I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ 

For manna from the sky \
A rock that won't run dry \
The body and blood of Christ \
Oh Lord, how You provide!

So thank You for my bread today \
And all that You supply \
Beyond my needs, abundantly \
You've given me Your life \
Beyond my needs, abundantly \
You've given me Your life

Lord, You gave me bread today \
So I will give You thanks \
Cuz all I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ \
Oh all I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ \
All I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ \
All I need You've given me \
And all I need is Christ

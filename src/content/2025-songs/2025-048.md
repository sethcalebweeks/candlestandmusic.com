title: 048 Nearer My god to Me
---

Nearer my god to Me \
Nearer to Me \
Forgo the daily cross \
Give me wealth and peace \
Health and prosperity \
Make it so clear to see \
You're nearer my god to Me \
Nearer to me

"Oh, I like that! Yeah, yeah, it's all about me."

And he said to all, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. \
Luke 9:23 ESV

 
Based on the hymn: **Nearer my God to Thee**

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! \
E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me, \
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee. \
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
